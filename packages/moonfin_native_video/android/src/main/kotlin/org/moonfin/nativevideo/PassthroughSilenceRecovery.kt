/**
 * Detects a bitstream AudioTrack that stopped producing sound and decides when
 * to rebuild it. Some TV audio HALs never resume a paused passthrough track,
 * and a replacement track opened while its predecessor is still tearing down
 * comes up just as dead, so recovery is a rebuild plus a short hold before the
 * new track opens.
 *
 * Everything here is armed by evidence and nothing engages on a healthy
 * device. A recovery needs a playback position that sat frozen for
 * [silenceThresholdMs] while the sink was playing bitstream audio and holding
 * unplayed data, which a running track never shows. A stream that hasn't
 * played anything since it was configured gets [startupGraceMs] instead,
 * since some sinks take well past the threshold to start a bitstream and a
 * rebuild in that window can leave no working track at all. The write hold
 * guards only flushes that happen after a detection, so seek latency
 * everywhere else is untouched. PCM output never engages any of it.
 *
 * The caller owns the clock, every entry point takes elapsed milliseconds, so
 * the logic stays a plain object a JVM test can drive.
