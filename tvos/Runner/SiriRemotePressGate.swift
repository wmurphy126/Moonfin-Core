/// Keeps the arrow presses tvOS makes out of touch surface swipes away from
/// the engine's key repeater.
///
/// The engine listens for arrow presses with gesture recognizers and repeats
/// a held arrow at the configured key repeat rate. A swipe on the touch
/// surface reaches it as an arrow press that the system holds down for as
/// long as the finger rests, so swiping and holding kept stepping focus long
/// after SiriRemoteGlide had stopped.
///
/// Only a swipe is worth holding back, and a swipe always has a finger on the
/// pad, so an arrow press arriving with the pad untouched is passed straight
/// on. That is every press an infrared or HDMI-CEC remote sends. A click on
/// the ring lands with the finger down, and a click is the one thing the
/// controller can vouch for, so it is let through on that.
///
/// The touch report comes from SiriRemoteGlide, which already reads the same
/// touch stream the arrow presses are made from. It arrives on its own path,
/// as does the click state, so each arrow recognizer waits a moment before it
/// decides, long enough for both to have landed and short enough to go
/// unnoticed.
